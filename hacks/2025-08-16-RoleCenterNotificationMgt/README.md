# AL Role Center Notification Management

A Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central AL extension that demonstrates how to hook into the Role Center before it fully loads using the `OnBeforeShowNotifications` event.

## üìã Overview

This extension is designed for AL developers and Business Central users who want to:
- Learn how to use Role Center notification events
- Understand event-driven programming in AL
- See practical examples of customer data manipulation
- Explore Customer table and page extensions

## ‚ú® Features

- **Role Center Event Handling**: Hooks into the Role Center before notifications are shown
- **Demo Customer Creation**: Automatically creates demo customers when the Role Center loads
- **Customer Management**: Includes functionality to delete selected customers
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Demonstrates proper event subscriber patterns
- **Table Extensions**: Shows how to extend the Customer table with custom fields

## üöÄ How It Works

### Core Components

1. **Event Subscribers Codeunit** (`EventSubscribers.codeunit.al`)
   - Subscribes to the `OnBeforeShowNotifications` event from Role Center Notification Mgt.
   - Acts as the entry point for custom logic before Role Center loads
   - ID: 50106

2. **Event Handler Codeunit** (`EventHandler.codeunit.al`)
   - Contains the business logic for handling Role Center events
   - Creates demo customers with predefined names
   - Manages customer number generation and setup
   - ID: 50107

3. **Customer Table Extension** (`Customer.TableExt.al`)
   - Extends the Customer table with an "Is Demo" boolean field
   - Used to identify and filter demo customers
   - Field ID: 50106

4. **Customer List Page Extension** (`CustomerList.PageExt.al`)
   - Adds a "Delete Selected Customers" action to the Customer List page
   - Allows bulk deletion of selected customer records
   - Demonstrates page extension capabilities

### Event Flow

1. Role Center starts loading
2. `OnBeforeShowNotifications` event is triggered
3. Event subscriber catches the event and calls the handler
4. Handler creates demo customers with predefined names
5. User is prompted to open the Customer List if new customers were created

### Demo Customers Created

The extension automatically creates the following demo customers:
- Isshin Ashina
- Aden Pierce
- Jeffrey Bulanadi
- Taylor NotTooWell
- Mr. P Sherman
- John Doe
- Juan Lazy
- Mad Afaka
